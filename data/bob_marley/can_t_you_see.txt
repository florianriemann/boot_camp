Can't you see
What you're doing to me, girl
I am bound
Won't you set me free (set me free)

Told me you loved me
Try to break my heart
You do such a trick girl
You gotta be smart
You gotta a heart
That be made of stone
A pity you don't know, while your fresh were grown

Can't you see 
What you're doing to me
I say girl
I am bound
Won't you set me free (set me free)

Let you jerk on my heart
And you shatter my brain
If you have conscience
Ain't that a shame
Told me you loved me
Try to break my heart
You do such a trick girl
You gotta be smart

Can't you see
What you're doing to me, girl
I say girl
I am bound
Won't you set me free
Set me free

Can't you see
What you're doing to me, girl
I am bound
Baby won't you set me free (set me free)

Let you dream on my heart
And you shatter my brain
If you have conscience
Ain't that a shame
Told me you loved me
Try to break my heart
You do such a trick girl
You gotta be smart

Can't you see
What you're doing to me, girl
I am bound
Won't you set me free
