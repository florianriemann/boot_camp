Chances are we're gonna leave now
Sorry for the victim now
Although my days are filled with sorrow
I see here, a bright tomorrow
Chances, chances are some might not hold out
Chances are, hang on right now
Do do do do my days are filled with sorrow
Ill stay here til bright tomorrow
Chances, chances are some might not hold out
Chances are, hang on right now
