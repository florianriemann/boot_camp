We singin'
Them belly full but we hungry
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A rain a-fall but the dirt it tough,
A pot a-cook but the food na 'nough

We're going to dance to Jah music, dance
We're gonna dance to Jah music, dance
Forget your sorrows and dance
Forget your troubles and dance
Forget your sickness and dance and dance and dance
Forget your weakness and dance

We're siggin'
Cost of living get so high,
The rich and poor, they start a cry
But now the weak must get strong
They singin' "Oh, what a tribulation"

Them belly full but we hungry
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A rain a-fall, the dirt it tough,
A pot a-cook but the food na 'nough
We're gonna chuck to Jah music, we're chuckin'
Me say we're chuckin' to Jah music, we're chuckin'

Them belly full but them hungry
A angry mob is a angry mob
A rain a-fall but the dirt it tough
A pot a-cook but the food na 'nough

Rain a-fall the dirt it tough
A pot a-cook food na 'nough 
An angry mob is a angry mob
A hungry man is a angry man

Rain a-fall the dirt it tough
A pot a-cook food na 'nough
Rain a-fall the dirt it tough
A pot a-cook now food na 'nough

They say a angry mob is a angry mob
A hungry mob is a angry mob
Then a hungry man is a angry man
A hungry man is a angry man
