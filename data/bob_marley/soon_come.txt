Soon come
Everytime I call
They tell me that you're soon come, soon come
I call you at your home
They tell me that you're soon come, soon come
I don't like hanging around
Or to be pushed around
I've got feelings for you now
I don't like the soon come

I call you on the phone
They tell me that you're soon come, soon come
I even call you at your home
They tell me that you're soon come, soon come
I don't like hanging around
Or to be pushed around
I've got feelings for you now
I don't like the soon come

I call you on the phone
They tell me that you're soon come, soon come
I even call you at your home
They tell me that you're soon come, soon come
But I don't like hanging around
Or to be pushed around
I've got feelings for you now
I don't like soon come

Stop your coming, soon come
