Ey!
This morning I woke up in a curfew
Oh God, I was a prisoner, too
Could not recognize the faces standing over me
All dressed in uniforms of brutality

How many rivers do we have to cross
Before we can talk to the boss?
I'm saying, all we got, it seems we have lost
We must have really paid the cost

That's why we gonna be burnin' and a-lootin' tonight
We're burnin' and a-lootin' tonight
Burnin' all pollution tonight
Oh, we're burnin' all illusion tonight

Ey!
Oh, give me the food and let me grow
Let the Roots Man take the gold
I say, 'cause all them drugs gonna make you slow, now
It's not the music from the ghetto

Eh!
Weeping and a-wailin' tonight
Weeping and a-wailin' tonight, lord, lord, lord, lord
Eh! (weeping and a-wailin' tonight)
Oh, (weeping and a-wailin' tonight) yeah!

How many rivers
How many rivers
Do we have to cross?
Talk to the boss
And one more, if all we got, we have lost
What I mean yeah, we must have really paid the cost

That's why we gonna be (burnin' and a-lootin' tonight)
Burning and a-lootin'
(Burnin' and a-lootin' tonight) lord, oh, lord, oh, lord, oh, lord
Burnin' all pollution tonight
