There she goes with the pieces from my heart
There she goes and now my teardrops start
And ere I go once again
Through these lonely heartaches and pain

That's all remain all remain
Now I know love is a guessin' game
She goes with the pieces from my heart
There she goes and now my teardrops start

Who's gonna put back the pieces to my broken heart
Once again, once again now I know this could be the end
And she gone with the pieces of my heart
There she goes and now my teardrops start

And here I go once again
Through these lonely heartaches and pain
That's all remain
Now I know this could be the end

She goes with de pieces from my heart
There she goes and now my teardrops start
There she goes with the pieces from my heart
