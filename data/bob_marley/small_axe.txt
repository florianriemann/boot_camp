Why boasteth thyself
Oh, evil men
Playing smart
And not being clever? Oh no
I said, you're working iniquity
To achieve vanity, yeah (if a-so a-so)

If you are the big tree
We are the small axe
Sharpened to cut you down (well sharp)
Ready to cut you down

These are the words
Of my master, keep on tellin' me
No weak heart
Shall prosper, oh no they can't!
And whosoever diggeth a pit, Lord
Shall fall in it, shall fall in it
Whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall bury in it, shall bury in it

If you are the big tree
We are the small axe
Sharpened to cut you down
Ready to cut you down

And whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall fall in it, fall in it
And whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall bury in it, shall bury in it

If you are the big, big tree
We have a small axe
Ready to cut you down (well sharp)
Sharpened to cut you down
If you are the big tree, let me tell you this
We are the small axe
Ready to cut you down (well sharp)
Sharpened to cut you down

If you are the big tree
We are the small axe
