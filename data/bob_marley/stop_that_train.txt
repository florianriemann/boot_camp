Stop that train, I'm leavin' today!
Stop that train, I'm leavin' anyway!
Stop that train, I'm leavin'
And I said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
I said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

All my good life I've been a lonely man
Teachin' my people who don't understand
And even though I tried my best
I still can't find no happiness

So I got to say
Stop that train, I'm leavin' oh, baby now!
Stop that train, I'm leavin', I don't care what you say!
Stop that train, I'm leavin'
And I said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
I said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

Some goin' east, and-a some goin' to west
Some stand aside to try their best
Some livin' big, but the most is livin' small
They just can't even find no food at all

I mean, stop it
Stop that train, I'm leavin', believe me, mm-hmm
Stop that train, I'm leavin', I don't mind!
Stop that train, I'm leavin'
And I said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
I said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

Stop that train, I'm leavin', believe me
Stop that train, I'm leavin', can't take it!
Stop that train, I'm leavin', got to be better!
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
I said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
