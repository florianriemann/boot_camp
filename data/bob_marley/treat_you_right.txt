What's wrong girl
You don't treat me like you used to do
Everything about you is brand new
You've changed
It's mighty strange

You've lost the greatest smile and you won't tell me why
It's plain to see the love light's gone now in your eyes
The world we built is dangling on a broken rope
But I've got hope 
Oh, oh, oh, I've got hope
I hope and pray that one day girl, you'll see the light
And then you'll know that all I want is just to treat you right

Baby, just to treat you right (treat you right)
Baby, just to treat you right (treat you right)
Baby, just to treat you right (treat you right)
Treat you right

What's wrong girl 
We aren't as close as we used to be
Is my imagination playing tricks on me
You've changed
Your actin' strange

You've lost the greatest smile and you won't tell me why
It's plain to see the love light's gone now in your eyes
The world we built is dangling on a broken rope
But I've got hope oh, oh, oh, yeah
I hope and pray that one day girl, you're gonna see the light
And then you'll know that all I want is just to treat you right

Baby, just to treat you right (treat you right)
Baby, just to treat you right (treat you right)
Baby, just to treat you right (treat you right)
Baby, just to treat you right
