No sun will shine in my day today; (no sun will shine)
The high yellow moon won't come out to play:
(that high yellow moon won't come out to play)
I said (darkness) darkness has covered my light,

(And the stage) and the stage my day into night, yeah.
Where is the love to be found? (oo-ooh-ooh)
Won't someone tell me?
'Cause my (sweet life) life must be somewhere to be found -

(Must be somewhere for me)
Instead of concrete jungle (la la-la!),
Where the living is harder (la-la!).

Concrete jungle (la la-la!):
Man you got to do your (la la-la!) best. wo-ooh, yeah.
No chains around my feet,
But I'm not free, oh-ooh!

I know I am bound here in captivity;
G'yeah, now - (never, never) I've never known happiness;
(Never, never) I've never known what sweet caress is -
Still, I'll be always laughing like a clown;

Won't someone help me? 'cause I (sweet life) -
I've got to pick myself from off the ground
(must be somewhere for me), he-yeah! -
In this a concrete jungle (la la-la!):
I said, what do you cry for me (la-la!) now, o-oh!
Concrete jungle (la la-la!), ah, won't you let me be (la la-la!), now.
Hey! oh, now!

I said that life (sweet life) - it must be somewhere to be found
(must be somewhere for me)
Oh, instead: concrete jungle (la-la!) - collusion (la-la!) -
Confusion (confusion). eh!

Concrete jungle (la-la!): baby, you've got it in.
Concrete jungle (la la-la!), now. eh!
Concrete jungle (la la-la!).

What do you stand(?) for me (la-la!), now?
