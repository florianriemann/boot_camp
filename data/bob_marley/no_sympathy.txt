I can't find no love
No sympathy
What kind of love
They've got for me
I'm on my way 
To happiness
Where I can find
Some peace and rest

When I'm in my trouble here
Only me feels the pain
Not one good word of advice 
From any of my so called friends

I can't find no love
No sympathy
What kind of love
They've got for me
I'm on my way 
To happiness
Where I can find
Some peace and rest

Might as well, might as well
I get out, I get out of hell
Hell would never be made for me
So I'm gonna search, search 'till I'm free

I can't find no love
No sympathy
What kind of love
They've got for me
I'm on my way 
To happiness
Where I can find
Some peace and rest
