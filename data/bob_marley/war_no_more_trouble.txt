Until the philosophy 
Which hold one race superior
And another
Inferior
Is finally
And permanently
Discredited
And abandoned
Well everywhere is war
Me say war.

And until there is no longer
First class and second class citizens of any nation
Until the color of a man's skin
Is of no more significance than the color of his eyes
I've got to say war.

And until the basic human rights
Are equally guaranteed to all,
Without regard to race
Dis a war.

Until that day
The dream of lasting peace,
The world citizenship
The rule of international morality
Will remain in but a fleeting illusion to be pursued,
But never attained,
Well everywhere is war, war.

War
War
War
War
War

And until the ignoble and unhappy regimes
That hold our brothers in South Africa,
Namibia,
In sub-human bondage
Have been toppled,
Utterly destroyed,
Well, everywhere is war

War
War

War in the east,
War in the west,
War up north,
War down south,
This is a war
A war
A war
Rumors of war.
Yes them war, them war
A rumors of war

'Cause until that day,
The African continent
Will not know peace,
We Africans will fight, we find it necessary
We know we shall win
We are confident
In the victory

Of good over evil
Of good over evil
Of good over evil

Well, everywhere is war
Me say war

War in the east,
War in the west,
War up north,
War down south,
Yes them war
Them war
Them war
Them war
Them war
Them war
Them war
Them war
Them war
Yes them war
