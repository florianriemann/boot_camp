Be nice
Be nice
Be nice
Be nice

I just wanna be happy
I don't wanna feel nasty
I'm tryna turn my vibration around so I can feel fantastic
Talking to myself in the mirror, telling me to cheer up
Everyone around got tears of a clown
And it's so cold like Siberia

But I do not want negative energy
If you get what you give, give me positivity (give it to me)

Hey, be different
Be nice
Just smile, I promise it'll change your life
Hey, be different
Be nice
Just smile, I promise it'll change your life

Be nice, be nice
Be nice, be nice
The love you give is the love you get
So be nice and change your life

Be nice
Be nice

I got a new direction
I ain't got no time for stressin'
I don't wanna carry no bad vibration
I don't wanna be in depression
I just wanna be cool, live my life without the problems
Everybody tryna push me down to the ground
But I ain't living life from the bottom

'Cause I do not want negative energy
If you get what you give, give me positivity (give it to me)

Hey, be different
Be nice
Just smile, I promise it'll change your life
Hey, be different
Be nice

Be nice, be nice
Be nice, be nice
The love you give is the love you get
So be nice and change your life

Be nice

Be nice

If we could all just find a way to fly away
To slip into a brighter days (say what?)
One step, so def', so right, go left, and do it to 'em right away
I'm talking to all of my leaders
We should just pow-wow, and all of us meet up
And fight for each other, not one another
And when we talk, be nice to each other
Be cordial, be glad, be happy not sad
Stay in your bag
And all of my bangers, that bang with their flag
Whether Cripp, or Blood, be good to each other
Be hood to each other
En la raza
Mi casa, su casa
On and on, love that we givin' keeps rollin' on
Rollin' on

Hey, be different
Be nice
Just smile, I promise it'll change your life

Hey, be different
