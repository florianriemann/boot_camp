Top of the morning
It's just something I wanted to address real quick
You know
There's a lot of people that didn't like 
Really appreciate the Unity Walk yesterday
Don't like peace and all that and I understand
When I was out there I didn't understand it either
They couldn't talk peace with me
They tried and I was like, "Nigga this school yard"
You can't find a homie in my generation
That put in more work than me 
You may find or two that puttin' in as much as me
But you ain't gon' find none that put in more than me

And I'm here to tell you that shit was worthless, bro
When they tried to peace, I didn't want to peace
Look where I'm at
This shit ain't cool, bro
Crazy part is, you go this way to me
Two cells that way, you got 60s
You go two cells this way you got Bloods
We wait for each other when we walk to Caf', bro
We united in here
Nigga might not hang with a nigga every day
But we know we got each other back
And I don't knock y'all out there don't gotta hang with the peace
But don't get on people that are
Some people just tired of this shit bro

One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, we got one
One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, we got one

For God so loved the world he gave us a good Crip
The late, great Neighborhood Nip
Dippin' in this L.A. Bullshit
'Bout as solid of youngsta as a nigga could get (yup)
Was nothin' like these thug phonies
Was always showin' love 
And big respect for all the Blood homies (whuttup!)
You understood the values in the youth
Man, I swear to God, nephew, you was the truth
Damn, how could this nigga do this?
It's 'cause every neighborhood Jesus, got a neighborhood Judas
Who hate to see yo' team ride rich
You see that envy and that pride
That's that green eyed bitch
Worse than a woman scorned (damn)
It'd be better for that man if he had never been born
But Mary, don't you mourn, Martha, don't you weep
You see, your son still affected us deep
Give us the faith to take that leap

One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, you got one
One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, we got one

All it take is one, one, one 
Brave Blood and one brave Crip
Standing up together like we did back on them slave ships
Out on high sea waves, fighting other whips
Steady hearing "Jesus saves" out of devil's lips
Shackled at the hips for the color of our skin
Hundreds of us, yeah, we knew we was brothers then
But here we go again, underneath the gun
They got us thinkin' we all different when we (one)
So I'm givin' thanks to the gangstas, givin' praise to the neighbors
Damus and Pirus, y'all got the whole world amazed
Special shout out to the Hoovers for showin us how it's done
Ain't nothin' greater when we unite as (one)
Ain't got no ulterior motives and no other agendas
Fakin' like you with us just like some puppet pretenders
We ready to end this
For every eye that still cries
It's time to realize God will rise when we tie us

One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, we got one love
One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, you got one
One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, you got one love
One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, you got one

One Blood, one Cuzz, yeah
One Blood, one Cuzz
Now put them all together, you got one, one, one
One Blood, one Cuzz
Motherhood, brotherhood ain't no other hood
just imagine if we all was one hood
Now put them all together, you got one
