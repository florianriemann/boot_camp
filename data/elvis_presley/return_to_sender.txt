Return to sender, return to sender

I gave a letter to the postman, he put it his sack
Bright in early next morning, he brought my letter back

She wrote upon it
Return to sender, address unknown
No such number, no such zone

We had a quarrel, a lover's spat
I write I'm sorry but my letter keeps coming back

So then I dropped it in the mailbox and sent it special D
Bright in early next morning it came right back to me

She wrote upon it
Return to sender, address unknown
No such person, no such zone

This time I'm gonna take it myself and put it right in her hand
And if it comes back the very next day then I'll understand

The writing on it
Return to sender, address unknown
No such number, no such zone

Return to sender, return to sender
Return to sender, return to sender
