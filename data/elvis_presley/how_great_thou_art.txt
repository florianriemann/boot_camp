Oh Lord my God
When I in awesome wonder
Consider all
The worlds thy hands have made
I see the stars
I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout
The universe displayed

When Christ shall come
With a shout of acclamation
And take me home
What joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow
In humble adoration
And there proclaim
My God, how great thou art

Then sings my soul
My savior God to thee (my God to thee)
How great thou art (how great thou art)
How great thou art (how great thou art)
Then sings my soul
My savior God to thee (my God to thee)
How great thou art
(How great thou art)

How great thou art
(How great thou art)
How great thou art (how great thou art)
