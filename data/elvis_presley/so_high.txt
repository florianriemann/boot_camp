Oh, well, He's so high (so high you can't get over Him)
So wide (so wide you can't get around Him)
So low (so low you can't get under him)
Great God Almighty (you must come in at the door)

Lord, He is high (so high you can't get over Him)
He is wide (so wide you can't get around Him)
I know he's so low (so low you can't get under him)
A mighty lamb (you must come in at the door)

Well I went down in the valley
You know I did over there stay
My soul got happy in the valley
You know I stayed right there all day

He is high (so high you can't get over Him)
He is wide (so wide you can't get around Him)
I know he's so low (so low you can't get under him)
A mighty lamb (you must come in at the door)

Well I ain't been to heaven
But I, I am told
The streets, the streets are pearl
You know the mighty-mighty-mighty gates are gold

He is high (so high you can't get over Him)
He is wide (so wide you can't get around Him)
