I want to soothe my my heart, I want to ease my mind
I want to move my shoes and see what I can find
I want to stand up tall and open up my eyes
I want to reach out my hand until I'm touchin' the skies
I was a poor lost lamb in a deep dark hole
But now I've found that light that's gonna save my soul
I used to drink, I used to smoke
I used to smoke, drink and dance the hoochy-coo
I used to smoke and drink
Smoke and drink and dance the hoochy-coo
Oh, oh, yeah
But now I'm standing on this corner praying for me and you

That's why I'm saved (I'm saved)
I'm saved (I'm saved)
People let me tell you 'bout kingdom come
You know I'm saved (I'm saved)
I'm saved (I'm saved)
Well, I can preach until you're deaf and dumb
I'm in that soul-saving army
Beating on that big bass drum (bass drum, hey, hey, hey)

I used to cuss, I used to fuss
I used to fuss, cuss, boogie all night long
I used to cuss and fuss and cuss and fuss
And cuss and fuss and boogie all night long
Well now I'm standing on this corner
I know right from wrong

That's why I'm saved (I'm saved)
I'm saved (yes, I'm saved)
People let me tell you 'bout kingdom come
You know I'm saved (I'm saved)
I'm saved (yes, I'm saved)
Well, now I can preach until you're deaf and dumb
I'm in that soul-saving army
Beating on that big bass drum (ooh yeah)

Oh yeah!

I used to lie (lie!) I used to cheat (cheat!)
I used to lie, cheat, step on people's feet
I used to lie and cheat (lie and cheat)
Lie and cheat and step on people's feet (lie and cheat)
Well now I'm steppin' on to glory salvation in my beat

Because I'm saved (I'm saved)
I'm saved (I'm saved)
People let me tell you 'bout kingdom come
I am saved (I'm saved)
I am saved (I'm saved)
Well, now I can preach until you're deaf and dumb
I'm in that soul-saving army
Beating on that big bass drum 
Oh, oh, yeah
Because I'm saved (I'm saved)
I'm saved (I'm saved)
People let me tell you 'bout kingdom come
You know I'm saved (Lord I'm saved)
I'm saved (yes I'm saved)
Well, now I can preach until you're deaf and dumb
I'm saved (I'm saved)
I'm saved (I'm saved)

How can I say? (I'm saved)
I am saved (I am saved)
Yeah, I'm saved
