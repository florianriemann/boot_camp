Shackled by a heavy burden
Need the Lord of gift and shame
Then the hand of Jesus touched me
And now I am no longer the same

For He touched me
Oh, He touched me
And oh, what joy
That floods my soul
Something happened
And now I know
He touched me and made me whole

Oh, since I met this blessed Savior
And since he cleaned and me me whole
Oh, I will never cease
Never cease to prise Him
I'll shout it while eternity rolls

For He touched me
Oh, He touched me (He touched me)
And oh, what a joy that floods my soul
Something happened
And now I know
He touched me 
And made me, oh
He touched me and made me whole
