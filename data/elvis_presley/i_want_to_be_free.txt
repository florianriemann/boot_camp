There's no joy in my heart, only sorrow
And I'm sad as a man can be
I sit alone in the darkness of my lonely room
And this room is a prison to me

I look at my window and what do I see?
(I want to be free, I want to be free)
I see a bird way up in a tree
(I want to be free, I want to be free)

I want to be free, free, free
(Oh yes, oh yes)
I want to be free like the bird in the tree
(Want to be free)

Oh, what good are my eyes? They can't see you
And my arms they can't hold you so tight
I have two lips that are yearning, but they're no good to me
'Cause I know I can't kiss you tonight

I look at my window and what do I see?
(I want to be free, I want to be free)
I see a bird way up in a tree
(I want to be free, I want to be free)

I want to be free, free, free
(Oh yes, oh yes)
I want to be free like a bird in a tree
(Want to be free)
I want to be free like a bird in a tree
(Want to be free)
