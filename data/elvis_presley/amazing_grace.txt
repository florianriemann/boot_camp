Amazing Grace!
Oh, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost
Oh, but now, now I'm found
Was blind, oh, but now I see

When we've been there
Ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days
To sing God's praise
Than when, when we've first begun

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
'Tis Grace has brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home

Amazing Grace!
Oh, how sweet the sound (how sweet the sound)
That saved a wretch like me (like me)
Oh, I once was lost
Oh, but now, now I'm found
Was blind, oh, but now I see
Was blind but now I see
