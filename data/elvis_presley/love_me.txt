Treat me like a fool
Treat me mean and cruel
But love me

Wring my faithful heart
Tear it all apart
But love me

If you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh-so lonely
I'll be sad and blue
Crying over you, dear, only

I would beg and steal
Just to feel your heart 
Beating close to mine

Well, if you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh-so lonely
I'll be sad and blue
Crying over you, dear, only

I would beg and steal
Just to feel your heart 
Beating close to mine

Well, if you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh-so lonely
Begging on knee
All I ask is, please, please, love me
Oh yeah
