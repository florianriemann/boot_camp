Born in the heat of the desert
My mother died givin' me life
Deprived of the love of a father
Blamed for the loss of his wife
You know Lord I've been in a prison
For something that I've never done
It's been one hill after another
And I've climbed them all one by one

Oh but this time Lord you gave me a mountain,
A mountain you know I may never climb
It isn't just a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time

My woman got tired of the heartaches
Tired of the grief and the strife,
So tired of working for nothing
Just tired of being my wife
She took my one ray of sunshine
She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living
She took my small baby boy

Yeah but this time Lord you gave me a mountain, 
A mountain I may never climb
It isn't a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time
Yeah Lord, You gave me a mountain
Don't you know 
You gave me a mountain this time
