## Data Science Projects at [Spiced Academy Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.spiced-academy.com/en). 

This repository presents some of the projects I had to implement throughout the 12-weeks Data Science Boot Camp. 

### Boot Camp Curriculum

* **week01: Visual Data Analysis** - (e.g. Pandas, Descriptive Statistics, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Aggregation, Data Wrangling, Long vs. Wide Format)
* **week02: Classification** - (e.g. Logistic Regression, Loss Function in Logistic Regression, Evaluating Classifiers, Feature Engineering, Decision Trees, Random Forests)
* **week03: Regression** - (e.g. Linear Regression, Regularization, Gradient Descent, Cross-Validation, Hyperparameter Optimization, Gradient Boosting)
* **week04: Text Classification**  - (e.g. Web Scraping, Regular Expressions, Language Models, Naive Bayes)
* **week05: Dashboard** - (e.g. PostgreSQL, Data Modeling, SQL Queries, AWS, Metabase)
* **week06: The Data Pipeline** - (e.g. Pipeline with Docker-Compose, MongoDB, ETL, Sentiment Analysis)
* **week07: Time Series Analysis** - (e.g. Analyzing Time Series, Autoregressive Model (AR), Evaluating Forecasts, ARIMA) 
* **week08: Markov Simulation & OOP** - (e.g. Markov Chains, Composition and Inheritance, Program Design, Python Code Style, NumPy, Collaboration with Git)
* **week09: Deep Learning** - (e.g. Artificial Neural Networks, Backpropagation, Keras, Training Strategies, Convolutional Neural Networks, Pretrained Networks, Transfer Learning)
* **week10: Recommender Systems** - (e.g. Unsupervised Learning, Principal Component Analysis, Collaborative Filtering with Matrix Factorization, Neighborhood-based Collaborative Filtering)
* **week11: Software Engineering** - (e.g. Automated Testing, Continuous Integration, Building Python Packages, Profiling Code, Deploying a Web Application)
* **week12: Final Project**

### Weekly Projects (selection)

#### Gapminder
* visually analyze the [Gapminder Dataset](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) and create an animated scatterplot 
* **Keywords:** Scatterplot, Descriptive statistics, Matplotlib, Seaborn
